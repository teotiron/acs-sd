The program simulates a galactic war between planets. Each planet has a
line of defense composed of shields, whose values are represented by integers.
Both the shield and the galaxy are implemented using a generic circular doubly
linked list that has the basic functions implemented (creation, adding a node,
removing a node, freeing the memory).

The program reads an integer M and M lines that represent actions. These
commands enable the user to add, remove, delete and collide planets and to
modify each planet's shield list. After the M lines have been read, the program
frees the memory used by the galaxy.
