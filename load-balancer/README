The program creates a load balancer using consistent hashing. Multiple
server tags are stored on a hashring and whenever an object is stored 
in the load balancer, it is added to the server whose tag has the lowest
hash value greater than the object's hash value.

When one server is removed, all of its objects are copied in temporary
storage. The server and its tags are removed from the hashring and the
objects in the temporary storage are added once again to the load balancer.

When one server is added, each of the new server replicas copies elements from
the server whose tag is situated after the current server replica's tag. After
the new servers receive their corresponding objects, those objects are removed
from their initial server.
